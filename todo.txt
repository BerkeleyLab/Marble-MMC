Mailbox features todo:
  DONE 1. mailbox update on interrupt (MISO line)
      PA6 ------> SPI1_MISO
      Need to switch MISO from GPIO_input to AF5 before every SPI transaction
        Also disable ISR
      Switch back when ISR is enabled
  DONE 2. mailbox timer disable entry
      Low-speed timer can peacefully coexist with IRQ mode
  3. mailbox magic word (implement but do not require yet)
  DONE 4. Add "pointer" entry type to mbox.def which passes "(void *)&page[enumName]"
     and "entrySize".  Perhaps I'll need a new special character for 'size'.
  5. Pmod pin state forwarder
     One entry for pmod mode (0 = disabled, 1 = GPIO, 2 = UART, 3 = SPI, 4 = I2C, etc)
     One entry for pmod data:
        In GPIO mode: 8 bits of pmod pin states to control MMC's pmod
        In UART, SPI, I2C modes: 8 bit Rx/Tx data

  DONE 6. mask out 'return' because we don't want that in the 'output' or 'input' fields of mbox.def
