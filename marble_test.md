# Marble PCB Test and Bringup Procedure

## Mechanical Checkout
1. Install heatsinks
    - 1 x big, with grease or thermal pad
    - 2 x small, adhesive
    - 5 x feet on back

2. Add or check sticker for serial number. Take note; this is used throughout bringup.

3. Measure resistance in ohms at the test points

4. 12V 2A bench supply (e.g. Keysight E36313A)
   - Plug in, see all 8 power LEDs on, record current (0.36 A)

5. Measure voltage at the test points

6. Connect cables
   - USB micro from host to J10
   - Segger J-Link from host to J14
   - Connect ethernet between host and J4
   - Configure host adapter settings as needed

## Program and Validate
### 1. Configure and run bringup script
Set paths as environment variables. E.g.:
```sh
# Mandatory
export BEDROCK_PATH=~/repos/bedrock
export MMC_PATH=~/repos/marble_mmc
export BITFILE=~/hardwareBin/marble2.c0222ba4.bit
export UDPRTX=~/bin/udprtx
```
Optionally define the TTY device identifiers for both the marble MMC and the FPGA.
Each marble board enumerates as 4 ttyUSB devices.  With no other ttyUSB devices
connected, these will be the following:
    Device  | Function
    --------|---------
    /dev/ttyUSB0 | JTAG programmer to FPGA
    /dev/ttyUSB1 | Reset channel. Connect and disconnect to reset the MMC.
    /dev/ttyUSB2 | UART channel to/from FPGA (default 9600 baud)
    /dev/ttyUSB3 | UART channel to/from MMC (default 115200 baud)
For example, if you have another device connected which enumerated as /dev/ttyUSB0,
the marble device handle assignments would be in the same order, but likely incremented
by one.  In this case, you can simply define two additional environment variables.
```sh
# Optional
export TTY_FPGA=/dev/ttyUSB3
export TTY_MMC=/dev/ttyUSB4
```

Run bringup.sh, passing the serial number for this marble board.
```sh
./bringup.sh $SERIAL_NUMBER
```

This script does the following
- Configures FTDI product ID and serial number
- Programs marble\_mmc
- Assigns IP and MAC addresses based on serial number
- Verifies ping and udprtx tests

### 2. Confirm frequency monitor output on FPGA UART (ttyUSB2)
- channel 0 (Ethernet Rx - 125 MHz)
- channel 1 (20 MHz)
- channel 2 (SI570 - 125 MHz)
- channel 3 (unused)

### 3. Record various device readouts and save it to a file
Three INA219 Voltage + current, SI570 output frequency
```sh
cd bedrock/projects/test_marble_family
sh first_readout.sh $IP 2>&1 | tee first_readout_$IP
```

### 4. Set FPGA boot flash OTP bits
See instructions in bedrock/badger/flash.md
```sh
python3 spi_test.py --ip $IP --id
python3 spi_test.py --ip $IP --config_init
```
Note that we don't yet have enough features implemented
to claim unbrickability: need watchdog on MMC and FREEZE bit setting
by FPGA when write-protect switch enabled.

### 5. Power cycle, and send bitfile to FPGA over USB again
```sh
BITFILE=$BITFILE ./mutil usb
```

### 6. Burn bitfile into address 0
```sh
python3 spi_test.py --ip $IP --add 0 --program $BITFILE --force_write_enable
```
takes about 146 seconds

### 7. Cycle power and confirm FPGA image loads
See FPGA DONE LED turn on after ~2 sec, and ping again
```sh
ping $IP
```
Note: IP address is set as `192.168.19.$SERIAL_NUMBER` in the default
configuration.


## Development Hardware Setup
Set up Linux computer (presumably laptop)
- suggest Debian 11 Bullseye or Ubuntu XX or Mint 20
- git clone bedrock
- cd bedrock/badger/tests && make udprtx && cp udprtx ~/bin/
- git clone marble\_mmc
- apt-get install build-essential git gcc-arm-none-eabi python3-serial openocd
- Need to build ftdi\_eeprom from source
- openocd may require special udev rules/permissions for Segger J-Link
- Configure network adapter for Gigabit Ethernet with route to 192.168.19.0/24

## Wishlist:
- Device DNA and XADC
- maibox â€“> MAX6639 temperature in C and speed in rpm
- record current and temperature at some point?
- check absolute cal of 125 MHz?  GPS or Rubidium?
- Pmod LEDs?
- DDR3 memory?  Michal did not check this.
