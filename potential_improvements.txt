Notes on potential improvements/fixes for marble_mmc firmware

1) UART activity is blocking - switch to DMA
  1a) Uses stack memory for write space. Needs linear allocator non-blocking calls
2) I2C uses shared write space between calls
  2a) Linear allocator again
3) General encapsulation issues - main.c is dumping ground for all kinds of functions/variables
4) Convert from single-character user input to \n-terminated strings
