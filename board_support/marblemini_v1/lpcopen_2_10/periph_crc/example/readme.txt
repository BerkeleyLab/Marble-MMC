Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) generator example

Example description
The CRC example demonstrates using the CRC engine for 8-bit, 16-bit, and
32-bit CRC computation. The CRC engine will run via CRC computations for 8-bit,
16-bit, and 32-bit blocks and verify the CRC checksum. The expected and actual
results of the test are output on the UART. If the test fails, the LED will
be on.

Special connection requirements
There are no special connection requirements for this example.
