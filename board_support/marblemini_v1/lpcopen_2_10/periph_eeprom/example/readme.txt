EEPROM example

Example description
The EEPROM example shows how to use EEPROM interface driver.
The examples allows you to place a small string in a single page of
the EEPROM and the string will remain across reset cycles.

To use the example, connect a serial cable to the board's RS232/UART port
and start a terminal program to monitor the port. The terminal program on
the host PC should be setup for 115K8N1.

Special connection requirements
There are no special connection requirements for this example.
