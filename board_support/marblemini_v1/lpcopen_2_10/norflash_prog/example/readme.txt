External NOR Flash tests

Example description
The Flash example shows how to use external NOR Flash using EMC.
The example allows you to place a small string in a sector of
the Flash and the string will remain across reset cycles.

To use the example, connect a serial cable to the board's RS232/UART port
and start a terminal program to monitor the port. The terminal program on
the host PC should be setup for 115K8N1.
