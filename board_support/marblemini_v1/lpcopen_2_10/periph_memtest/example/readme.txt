Memory test example
This example shows how to do a (more complex) memory test for
verifying DRAM operation. The test performs walking 0 and 1,
address and inverse address, and pattern tests on DRAM.

Example description
This example runs a few memory tests on external DRAM memory. The tests include
walking 0 and 1, address and inverse address, and pattern tests.

These tests are meant to be run via a debugger inside IRAM and will not run
standalone.

Special connection requirements
There are no special connection requirements for this example.
